### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Edward. These are my repos as I work along in The Odin project and some learning side projects. I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with Node. I was a scientist for 20 years in the field of Histotechnology and I own the company Okinawan Steel and make high-end forged kitchen knives.
